# Falling-servers-anomaly-detection

Learning multivariate models allows us to learn dependencies and interactions among the components of the random variables which in turns allows to draw conclusion about the world. In this lesson, we will implement anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. we will start with 2D data and detect anomalous servers based on two features. We will plot the 2D data and see the algorithm's performance on a 2D plot. We will use a gaussian (normal) model to detect anomalous examples in our dataset
